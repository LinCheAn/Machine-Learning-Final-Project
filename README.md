# Machine-Learning-Final-Project
## Brief introduction
In this project, we have to analyze the given testing study then construct a model, which can be used to predict the product failure.  
To better accomplish this task, we need to choose an appropriate model, analyze the effect of different parameters on the results, and then impute the missing block in the data set.
## Environment details
* Python version: 3.9.7  
* scikit-learn version: 0.24.2  
* pandas version: 1.3.4  
## Load trained model
* Step 1. Download model_1, model_2, model_3  
* Step 2. Put all of them in the same directory as 109550088_Final.ipynb  
* Step 3. Run the second part of code in 109550088_Final.ipynb
